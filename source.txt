This is a widget that was made to be used within the Center for E-Learning's Learning Object architecture. It can be used anywhere on the web that uses HTML, CSS, and JS to get the job done.

This is an easy one.

// ================== The JS
// Insert this at the top of the linked JS file.
// The ID needs to match the ID in the HTML structure.
// Change "The answer" to whatever you want to fill in the blank.


document.getElementById("fillBlank1").addEventListener("click", function(){this.innerHTML = " The answer ";}, false);


// ================= The HTML Structure.
<!-- It's all about that span element. Wrap that span element around any blank, and it will fill it in with whatever you put to replace "The answer" from the JS.  -->

<ol>
<li>
    <p>
    <span id="fillBlank1" class="CEL-questionBlank">___________</span>are products that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has evaluated in order to determine if the products meet a meal pattern requirement.
    </p>
    </li>
</ol>

// ============== The CSS Styles

/* This gives the blank a hover state background color, and since it already exists in the linked CSS you shouldn't have to touch this style, but I put it here for reference just in case.  */
.CEL-questionBlank:hover{background-color: #bbcff6;}
